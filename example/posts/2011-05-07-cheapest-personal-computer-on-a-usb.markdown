No one would have thought that they could ever buy a computer for $25. Thanks to the smart game developer from [Frontier Developments](http://www.frontier.co.uk/), [David Braben](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Braben) who designed [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), a $25 dollar computer with the size of a USB Stick, infact it is actually a USB Stick Computer. Have a look,

This tiny device comes with an HDMI port in one end and a USB port on the other. You can plug it into a HDMI socket and then connect a keyboard via the USB port turns it into a fully functioning machine running a flavour of Linux. And the Hardware Specs are not that bad at all. It boasts a 700MHz ARM11 processor coupled with 128MB of RAM and runs OpenGL ES 2.0 allowing for decent graphics performance with 1080p. Yes 1080p. You can also add an SD card to the SD card slot for your storage needs. Did I already mention that you can also mount a 12MP camera into this?

It looks like the stock OS it ships with is Ubuntu. That means you can browse, run office apps or do whatever you want to do with a computer. Braben argues that the new ICT syllabus in schools have changed a lot and no one is teaching programming and the internals of computer systems. They are now teaching other *useful* skills like writing documents in a word processor, how to create presentations etc. This could be his effort to bring back the good stuff back to schools by making an affordable computer for students.
