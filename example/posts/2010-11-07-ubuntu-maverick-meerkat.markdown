<!--begin excerpt-->
I installed the new [Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) on my Laptop and on my Desktop at home. Now both systems doesn't have Windows in it. My family is now very comfortable with Ubuntu and they use the Ubuntu machine for working with [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org), watching movies, playing [games](http://2dboy.com/games.php) and for using Internet.

BTW, I really like the new Ubuntu font which gives Ubuntu a brandish look. I mean like Mac :-)
